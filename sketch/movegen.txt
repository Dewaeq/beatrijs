// A non-king move is legal if and only if it is not pinned or it
// is moving along the ray towards or away from the king.
return   !(pinned_pieces(us) & from)
    ||  aligned(from, to_sq(m), square<KING>(us));

interesting note:
perft speed increased by 2-3x just by using a movelist instead of a vector
